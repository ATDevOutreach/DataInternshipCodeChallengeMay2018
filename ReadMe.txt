#Africa's Talking Coding Challenge 

Task 1 - If you copy paste a set of steps more than 3 times, it’s time to write a function.

Task 2 - Given a dataset on any one of Africa’s Talking products: Voice, SMS, Payments and USSD. Discuss the steps you would take to analyse the data to reach a conclusion.
I would start by formulating a research question for example determining how efficient the Voice is for the company's customers. This can be tested by determining how many more customers use voice over the sms option or looking at customer reviews on the voice product offered by the company. Once the data is collected then it can be analysed in that we are looking for what percentage of customers are satisfied with the voice product(or any of the other products). A higher percentage of customers satistified with the voice product would show that the product is efficient. Determining the degree of efficiency would include probably calculating how responsive voice calls are. 


Task 3 - Give an example explaining how K-means clustering works.
K-means clustering is often used when working with unlabeled data. 
With this algorithm we can find groups in the data where the number of groups are represented by the variable K. 
Data points are assigned to one of K groups based on a certain feature similarity.

For example if Africa's Talking wishes to open branches all over Africa. Assuming that Africa's Talking knows the location of where their most customers are situated then they have to decide the number of branches to be opened and the location of the branches so that all their customers are in close vicinity of the new branches.\
With K-means clustering the locations with most customers will be grouped into clusters and a cluster center(most central location within each country in Africa for this example) for each cluster will be defined which will be the locations where the comapny branches will be opened. K-means clustering will help us make sure that the Africa's Talking branches will be at minimum distance from all the customers we are trying to reach.
